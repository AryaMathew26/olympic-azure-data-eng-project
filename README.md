# Tokyo Olympics - Azure Data Engineering Project

This project showcases a comprehensive end-to-end Extract, Transform, Load(ETL) pipeline built on the Azure cloud platform. The project encompasses a series of stages, from the ingestion of raw Olympic data to its transformation into a format suitable for analysis, and ultimately, the generation of insights. This cohesive pipeline leverages various Azure services to seamlessly orchestrate and streamline the entire ETL process.

1. Azure Data Factory: A cloud-based data integration service used to create data-driven workflows in the cloud for orchestrating and automating data movement and data transformation.
2. Azure Storage: Azure Storage functions as a data lake, to store both raw and processed data, providing a scalable and cost-effective solution for storing and managing diverse datasets within the Azure cloud environment.
3. Azure Databricks: A comprehensive cloud-based analytics platform that serves as a powerhouse for data processing, transformation, and analysis. Designed on the Apache Spark framework, it offers a collaborative and interactive environment, making it a preferred choice for running Spark-based jobs.
4. Azure SQL Database: Acts as the repository for cleaned and transformed data, facilitating accessibility for visualization and reporting, thereby offering a robust and relational database solution within the Azure platform.
5. Synapse Analytics: Used to conduct fundamental analytics tasks on the transformed data in Azure SQL Database through SQL queries within the Synapse Analytics workspace.
